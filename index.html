            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Base (Stew):</strong> Blend the tomatoes, red bell peppers, scotch bonnet peppers, and one onion until smooth. Pour this mixture into a pot and boil it down until most of the water has evaporated, and the paste is thick.</li>
                <li><strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> In a separate large pot, heat the vegetable oil. Slice the remaining onion and fry it until it turns translucent and fragrant. Add the tomato paste and fry for about 5-7 minutes, stirring continuously to prevent burning. Frying the tomato paste is key for a rich flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine and Season:</strong> Pour the boiled tomato-pepper mix into the pot with the fried tomato paste. Add the chicken/beef stock, seasoning cubes, curry, thyme, and salt. Stir everything together. Add the bay leaves for a distinct aroma.</li>
                <li><strong>Add the Rice:</strong> Wash your rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Add the washed rice directly into the pot with the stew. Stir well to ensure every grain is coated in the tomato mixture.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong> Cover the pot tightly with a lid or foil to trap the steam. Lower the heat to a gentle simmer. Allow the rice to cook undisturbed. This is where the magic happens. The rice will absorb the liquid and cook perfectly.</li>
                <li><strong>The Final Touch:</strong> After about 30-40 minutes, check the rice. If it’s almost done but a little dry, add the butter/margarine, cover the pot again, and let it steam for a final 10 minutes. The butter gives it a beautiful sheen and rich flavor.
                7.	Serve: Fluff the rice with a fork before serving. Your Jollof Rice is ready to be enjoyed!</li>

            </ol>
